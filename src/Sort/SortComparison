 This problem is to sort the array with the different methods
 inplace doesn't equal the space complexity of O(1); the space includes the recursion call stack; whereas inplace not;

 // bubble / insertion/ selection can also do O(1) space but slow; (inplace)

 // Average NlogN time complexity
 merge sort : inplace or non-inplace, depending on how to merge;
 quick sort : inplace, not stable,
 heap sort : inplace

 non-inplace method (Non-comparison based sorting):
 Radix sort
 Count Sort
 Bucket Sort

 // Online algo : only insertion algo is the online one;

// unstable algo: heap sort / quick sort / selection sort;
