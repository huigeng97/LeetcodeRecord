This is the Schedule for some questions deserves to work on;

The union find questions deserve to write everyday

This Weekend I will review all the parts I have finished so far; 06/20
UnionFind;                        547
Sliding Window;                   295, (76?);
Two Pointers;                     407;
Sort; (mergeSort   , QuickSort 973, HeapSort?, general sort problem);
BinarySearch; 4
